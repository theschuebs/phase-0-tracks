#What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* Linux is a multiuser, multi-tasking system with a full set of UNIX compatible tools. It adheres to traditional UNIX semantics and there are three main bodies of code: THE KERNEL, THE SYSTEM LIBRARIES< and THE SYSTEM UTILITIES. From what I read, it sounds like cost is a primary reason Linux is popular. It's free and flexible. Unix is proprietary. 


#In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

* A VPS is a virtual machine that can host websites. You basically purchase a chunk of space so you or anyone you give permission to can access the files for anything you create (websites, web apps, etc.) The advantages to a VPS is that you get your OWN space (versus shared). However, it can be pricier and you are in charge of maintaining that space (which could be seen as an advantage or disadvantage.)

#Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

* The root user is considered the SUPER-USER!! It's better practice to create your own username under the root. This allows others to create their own user as well.
