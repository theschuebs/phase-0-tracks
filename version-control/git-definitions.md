# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows developers to edit and revise code. It is useful because it minimizes conflicts when developers are collaborating on projects and many revisions of code may need to occur by different people.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch allows a developer to work on a code revision without directly adding it to the master copy right away. This allows the developer time to decide what and how to merge the code at a later time.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a saved copy of the code. A good commit message is detailed as to what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when developers are trying to change part of the same file and when they try to merge them, a conflict occurs.
