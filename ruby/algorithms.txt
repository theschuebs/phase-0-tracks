Algorithm for using an elevator:

Walk up to the elevator doors. Identify button. Push up button or down button to send for elevator. Once the elevator arrives and doors open, step into the elevator. Determine destination floor. Identify buttons in elevator. Press button number that corresponds to destination floor. If destination floor is floor five, count five buttons up. If doors do not close, press the close doors button. If doors shut, wait until elevator doors open to destination floor. Doors may open to a floor that is not the destination floor. If that is the case, stay on the elevator until destination floor is reached. Exit the elevator.

Squeeze a penny-sized drop of toothpaste onto the toothbrush bristles. Put toothpaste down. Raise toothbrush up to mouth. Open mouth. Insert toothbrush bristles into mouth and move brush back and forth and up and down until all teeth have been brushed. After one minute, remove toothbrush from  mouth. Spit extra toothpaste into sink. Insert toothbrush back in mouth. Repeat the brushing and spitting process for additional minute. Turn on faucet. Rinse out mouth and rinse bristles under running water. Turn off faucet. Return toothbrush to medicine cabinet. Smile!
